Really boring bash script for createing chapters from M4B (Audiobook files) in your audiobook library
---
This bash script 
(1) automates directory traversal in a generic fassion. 
(2) runs the correct M4B-tool command to create MP3 chapters 

The script uses the [M4B-tool](https://github.com/sandreas/m4b-tool) created by [Sandress] (https://github.com/sandreas)

So obviously you will need to install Sandress's code first.
